            aminating in printing refers to the process of applying a thin layer of plastic film to printed materials to enhance their durability, appearance, and protection. This process helps shield prints from moisture, dirt, scratches, and general wear and tear, making them last longer. There are two main types of lamination: glossy and matte. Glossy lamination enhances colors and gives prints a vibrant, reflective finish, while matte lamination provides a smooth, non-reflective surface for a more sophisticated look. Laminating is commonly used for items that require frequent handling, such as business cards, menus, posters, ID cards, and book covers. It also improves the rigidity of the material, making it feel more premium and professional. The process can be done through thermal lamination, where heat activates the adhesive, or cold lamination, which uses pressure-sensitive adhesive. Choosing lamination in printing ensures that documents maintain their quality over time, providing both aesthetic and functional benefits.
