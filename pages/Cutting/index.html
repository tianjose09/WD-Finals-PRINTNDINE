            utting in printing refers to the process of trimming printed materials to their final size or shape, ensuring a clean and professional appearance. It is a crucial step in print production, as it removes excess paper, aligns edges, and enhances the overall presentation of the finished product. Various cutting methods are used depending on the type of project and precision required. Guillotine cutting is a common technique that uses a sharp blade to cut through multiple sheets at once, making it ideal for bulk printing. Die cutting, on the other hand, allows for custom shapes and designs, such as rounded corners or intricate patterns, which are often used for packaging, labels, and promotional materials. Laser cutting provides high precision for detailed designs, often used in specialty prints and artistic projects. Proper cutting ensures that all printed pieces are uniform and meet exact specifications, preventing misalignment and uneven edges. This step is essential for achieving a polished and professional look, especially in business cards, brochures, booklets, and invitations.
